    content: `Every great band needs a little luck. And for [Survivor](https://www.loudersound.com/features/buyer-s-guide-survivor) it came in 1981 when Sylvester Stallone commissioned them to write the theme song for the third movie in his blockbuster Rocky franchise. Stallone loved the Chicago rockers’ minor hit Poor Man’s Son, and wanted an anthem in a similar vein. “Something with a pulse!” he said.

### Lyrics
> Risin' up, back on the street
> Did my time, took my chances
> Went the distance, now I'm back on my feet
> Just a man and his will to survive
> 
> So many times, it happens too fast
> You trade your passion for glory
> Don't lose your grip on the dreams of the past
> You must fight just to keep them alive
>
> ...
